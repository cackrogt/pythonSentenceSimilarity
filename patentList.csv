"Part 1","This is Betty a 12 000 EMG machine who is going to help us determine what the best chest exercises actually are. How does this all work I'll explain in a minute but here's a hint. "
"Part 2","let's talk about why I bought a 12 000 piece of equipment in the first place. I remember the first time I watched Crazy Stupid Love and saw Ryan Gosling's ripped muscular body on screen and I thought to myself damn I would feel incredible if I looked like that. "
"Part 3","It's like a Photoshop so at 15 years old weighing in at a frail 120 pounds I decided to dive head first into the gym but almost instantly I became confused and overwhelmed with what to do. Everyone had a different opinion on how to train and what to eat I tried it all and while I saw some results I just wasn't satisfied until one day during my studies in University I accidentally came across a 2010 study titled the mechanisms of muscle hypertrophy and their application to resistance training."
"Part 4","This paper dove into the science behind what made muscles grow and how to apply that science to your training. I was fascinated."
"Part 5","I felt like I stumbled upon a gold Mark. I started reading more studies and applying these methods to my own training and my results skyrocketed."
"Part 6","I taught these methods to my friends and my family and the same effect happened there. Finally a source of truth I could actually trust."
"Part 7","That's when I went all in to pursue a career in Fitness learning from the experts and dissecting the research in a way that the average Joe could understand to apply. However I wanted to go a step further."
"Part 8","I want to not only communicate research and spread the truth to the world but I want to be a part of that research process which brings me back to Betty. she's what's known as an EMG machine."
"Part 9","just don't tell her that she likes to feel human. EMG stands for electromyography and it's a way of measuring the electrical activity produced by muscles when they contract."
"Part 10","researchers use this to assess how well different exercises are at activating our muscles. but there's a problem. "
"Part 11","I haven't used this machine since back in University and I want to make sure I run this experiment as best as possible so that we and you can actually trust the data. so I called up a few colleagues of mine and they led me to John a master's student specializing in EMG who taught me everything I needed to know finally Betty and I were ready for our first test run foreign stick this on."
"Part 12","all right it's a moment of truth. so you see this green that is my bicep after getting the hang of her."
"Part 13","Betty, a 12,000 EMG machine, helps determine the best chest exercises"
"Part 14","The speaker, a fitness enthusiast, discovered the importance of muscle hypertrophy and applied it to their training."
"Part 15","They pursued a career in fitness, learning from experts and dissecting research in a way that the average Joe could understand"
"Part 16","Betty helps them run experiments and ensures the accuracy of the data."
"Part 17","The speaker's bicep is shown in the video."
